# graphqlEx
graphql integration using apollo + postgres

This codeRepo will help you to
1. Define a GraphQL schema that represents the structure of your data set
2. Run an instance of Apollo Server that lets you execute queries against your schema

## Dependencies

* apollo-server-express: provides direct connection between Express and Apollo GraphQL server.
* graphql: is the library used to build a GraphQL schema and execute queries against it.
* sequelize: the Node.js ORM for Postgres that we’ll use to facilitate the job of communicating with the database.
* bcrypt: it’ll be used to hash our passwords.
* express and express-jwt: the Express framework itself along with the middleware for validating JWT (JSON Web Tokens) via the jsonwebtoken module.
